                <p>
                    <strong>Adam Wunder, Privacy Officer for PetVerse</strong><br>
                    Email: cozycatapp@gmail.com<br>
                    Kitchener, ON N2M 5C7
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data PetVerse collects, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data. By using the App, you consent to the data practices described in this section.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
            <p>To access any PetVerse features, you must create a user account. During sign-up we collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>Display name</li>
                <li>Password (securely stored)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not require sensitive personal data (e.g., home address, government IDs). Please refrain from sharing such information in AI chat or elsewhere in the App.</p>

            <h3>1.2 AI Chat Input & History</h3>
            <p>All text you send to PetVerse's AI chat is forwarded in real time to OpenAI's API to generate replies.</p>
            <p>Your chat history is stored in Cloud Firestore under your account so you can continue conversations across devices. We do not use your chat content for any purpose other than syncing your history and fetching AI responses.</p>
            <p>Chat history is not stored on our servers outside Firestore.</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Important:</strong> OpenAI may retain your inputs for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring. Do not include private or sensitive information in your chats.
            </div>

            <h3>1.3 Health & Usage Data</h3>
            <p>Every metric you log (water intake, litter-box activity, weight, energy level, medication/vaccination notes, etc.) is tied to your account and synced to our backend.</p>
            <p>We use this data solely to power and personalize your pet-care experience and to generate accurate AI insights.</p>

            <h3>1.4 Device & Technical Information</h3>
            <p>We automatically collect non-personal technical details via Firebase Analytics (or equivalent), including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
                <li>Unique device identifier and IP address</li>
                <li>Timestamps and in-app events (e.g., which screens you visit, how often you use features)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To sync your data and queue actions when offline, PetVerse requires INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions—so we can detect connectivity and retry failed requests.</p>
            
            <h4>Analytics Consent:</h4>
            <p>On first launch we ask if you'd like to help improve PetVerse by sharing anonymous usage data. You can withdraw consent at any time via <strong>User Account Settings > Privacy > Share Usage Analytics</strong>. Turning this off disables all new analytics data collection.</p>
            
            <h4>Retention:</h4>
            <p>We retain analytics identifiers for up to 12 months. After 6 months, raw device IDs and debug logs are irreversibly de-identified or deleted.</p>

            <h3>1.5 Permissions & Sensor Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage/Media (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE):</strong> Requested only if you choose to import or export photos (e.g., custom avatars). Any accessed files remain under your control; we do not store them on our servers unless you explicitly sync them as part of your profile or pet records.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS):</strong> We request this so we can remind you about logged events (e.g., medication schedules, weight checks).</li>
                <li><strong>Exact Alarms (SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM & USE_EXACT_ALARM):</strong> Needed to fire medication, metric-check, and vet-visit reminders at precise times.</li>
                <li><strong>No other sensors:</strong> PetVerse does not request access to your microphone, camera, contacts, location, or any other personal datasets—only the permissions listed above.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information you provide and the technical data we collect for the following purposes. Wherever applicable, we indicate whether a use is mandatory or opt-in, and which data categories power each purpose.</p>
