                <p>We want you to be satisfied with your experience using PetVerse. This Refund Policy explains how we handle refunds for in-app purchases and subscriptions.</p>

                <h3>Purchases Through Google Play Store</h3>
                <p>All monetary transactions for PetVerse are processed exclusively by the Google Play Store. PetVerse does not collect or store your payment information. <strong>Google's refund policies apply:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can request a refund directly via the Play Store within 48 hours of purchase</li>
                    <li>After 48 hours, refund requests are handled case-by-case by Google support</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Our Refund Policy Terms</h3>
                <p>Because digital goods are delivered instantly, our general policy is that purchases are final and non-refundable once you have accessed the premium content. However, we will consider refund requests for:</p>

                <h4>1. Accidental Purchase</h4>
                <p>If you accidentally purchased a feature and have not meaningfully used it, contact Google Play immediately and email us at cozycatapp@gmail.com within 7 days. If we verify it was accidental and unused, we will support your request with Google.</p>

                <h4>2. Technical Issues</h4>
                <p>If a paid feature is completely unusable due to a fault on our side—and we cannot resolve it within 14 days—we will instruct Google to refund your purchase or refund you directly where possible.</p>

                <h4>3. Unauthorized Purchase</h4>
                <p>If someone made a purchase on your device without permission, report it to Google Play and email us right away. We will assist in any way we can.</p>

                <h4>4. Dissatisfaction</h4>
                <p>If you're genuinely dissatisfied—especially soon after purchase—email us within 14 days with details. Though not guaranteed, we may offer a full or partial refund or suggest alternatives.</p>

            <!-- COOKIES POLICY -->
            <section id="cookies" class="section">
                <h2>Cookies Policy</h2>

                <p>This Cookies Policy explains how PetVerse uses "cookies" and similar technologies in our Android app and any related web content.</p>

                <h3>What Are Cookies and Similar Technologies?</h3>
                <p>In a mobile app context, these include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Storage or Preferences:</strong> The App saves data on your device (tutorial flags, UI settings) to remember state between sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We use system-provided identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID) for analytics and functionality</li>
                    <li><strong>Webview Cookies:</strong> When PetVerse opens web content in an in-app browser, those pages may set standard HTTP cookies</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How We Use Cookies / Data Storage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Functions:</strong> We store minimal local state to ensure the app works smoothly</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics and Performance:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics only if you've opted in (withdraw consent via Settings > Privacy > Share Usage Analytics)</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication & Sync:</strong> Cloud Firestore relies on local storage caching for offline support</li>
                    <li><strong>Preferences & UI Customization:</strong> We remember your theme choice or layout settings between sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Content:</strong> External websites opened in PetVerse's webview may set their own cookies under their policies</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Third-Party Cookies/Technology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Uses Android Advertising ID; only collects data if you opted in</li>
                    <li><strong>Crashlytics:</strong> May collect device info and optional user ID tags for crash reports (purged on 90-day cycle)</li>
                    <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Does not set any client-side cookies; all processing is server-side</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Your Choices and Controls</h3>
                
                <h4>To limit or reset device identifiers on Android:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open Settings > Google > Ads</li>
                    <li>Enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization"</li>
                    <li>Tap "Reset Advertising ID" to generate a new identifier</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>To clear webview cookies:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to Settings > Apps > PetVerse</li>
                    <li>Choose Storage & cache</li>
                    <li>Select "Clear storage" or "Clear cache"</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> The standard Do Not Track browser setting is not applicable in Android apps. We do not engage in cross-app tracking beyond the aggregated, opt-out-eligible analytics described above.</p>

                <h3>Changes to This Cookies Policy</h3>
                <p>We will update this policy if we change how we use cookies or similar technologies (for example, adding ad networks). We will notify you in-app for material changes.</p>
