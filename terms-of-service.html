            <h3>Reminder & Notification Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>
                While PetVerse uses exact alarms and push notifications to deliver reminders (e.g. medication,
                vet visits, metric checks), we cannot guarantee delivery timing or reliability.
                You are responsible for independently verifying critical reminders.
            </p>

                <li>Any direct or indirect damages resulting from use or inability to use the App</li>

                unless otherwise required by applicable law.

            <h3>Third-Party Services Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>
                PetVerse relies on third-party services such as OpenAI, Firebase, and Google Play services.
                We are not responsible for the acts, omissions, outages, or data practices of these providers.
                Any issues arising from third-party services are outside our control.

            <!-- REFUND POLICY -->
            <section id="refund" class="section">
                <h2>Refund Policy</h2>

                <p>
                    We want you to be satisfied with your experience using PetVerse.
                    This Refund Policy explains how we handle refunds for in-app purchases,
                    including one-time purchases and subscriptions. Please review this
                    section carefully if you have purchased or plan to purchase premium features.
                </p>

                <h3>Purchases Through Google Play Store (Android Only)</h3>
                <p>
                    All monetary transactions for PetVerse are processed exclusively through
                    the Google Play Store. PetVerse does not collect or store your credit-card
                    or payment information. <strong>Google Play’s refund policies apply:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may request a refund directly through Google Play within 48 hours of purchase</li>
                    <li>After 48 hours, refund requests are handled on a case-by-case basis by Google support</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If PetVerse becomes available on another platform in the future
                    (such as the Apple App Store), that platform’s refund rules will apply.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Refund Policy Terms</h3>
                <p>
                    Because digital goods and subscriptions are delivered instantly
                    (or over an active subscription period), purchases are generally
                    final and non-refundable once premium content has been accessed.
                    However, we will consider refund requests under the following circumstances:
                </p>

                <h4>1. Accidental Purchases</h4>
                <p>
                    If you accidentally purchased a feature and have not meaningfully used it,
                    contact Google Play immediately and email us at
                    <a href="mailto:cozycatapp@gmail.com">cozycatapp@gmail.com</a>
                    within 7 days of purchase. If we verify the purchase was accidental
                    and unused, we will support your refund request with Google.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Technical Issues</h4>
                <p>
                    If a paid feature or subscription is completely unusable due to a fault
                    on our side and we cannot resolve the issue within 14 days,
                    we will instruct Google to issue a refund or refund you directly
                    where legally and technically possible.
                </p>

                <h4>3. Unauthorized Purchases</h4>
                <p>
                    If someone made a purchase on your device without your permission,
                    report the issue to Google Play immediately and notify us right away.
                    While refunds cannot be guaranteed, we will assist in any reasonable way we can.
                </p>

                <h4>4. Dissatisfaction</h4>
                <p>
                    If you are genuinely dissatisfied with a purchase—particularly shortly
                    after completing it—contact us within 14 days with details.
                    While refunds are not guaranteed, we may offer a full or partial refund
                    or suggest alternatives to improve your experience.
                </p>

                <h3>How to Request a Refund</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use Google Play’s refund process for the purchase (fastest method)</li>
                    <li>
                        If that does not resolve the issue, email
                        <a href="mailto:cozycatapp@gmail.com">cozycatapp@gmail.com</a>
                        with:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your purchase receipt or order ID</li>
                            <li>Date of purchase</li>
                            <li>Reason for the refund request</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We will acknowledge refund-related emails within 5 business days
                    and aim to provide a full response within 30 days.
                </p>

                <h3>Subscriptions &amp; Cancellations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Google Play account settings</li>
                    <li>Canceling stops future auto-renewal but does not refund the current billing period</li>
                    <li>You will retain access to subscription features until the current period expires</li>
                    <li>
                        If you cancel early and believe you are entitled to a partial refund
                        for unused time, contact us—some jurisdictions require prorated refunds
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>No-Refund Circumstances</h3>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to decline refund requests in cases involving:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suspected fraud or abuse (such as repeated purchase-and-refund behavior)</li>
                    <li>Consumption of most or all of a paid service before requesting a refund</li>
                    <li>Accounts terminated for violations of our policies or Terms</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Statutory Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    This Refund Policy does not affect any statutory rights you may have under
                    applicable law. For example, users in the European Union may have a
                    14-day withdrawal right under the Consumer Rights Directive,
                    unless they have consented to immediate digital performance.
                    Please reference any applicable statutory right when contacting us.

            <!-- COOKIES POLICY -->
            <section id="cookies" class="section">
                <h2>Cookies Policy</h2>

                <p>This Cookies Policy explains how PetVerse uses "cookies" and similar technologies in our Android app and any related web content.</p>

                <h3>What Are Cookies and Similar Technologies?</h3>
                <p>In a mobile app context, these include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Storage or Preferences:</strong> The App saves data on your device (tutorial flags, UI settings) to remember state between sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We use system-provided identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID) for analytics and functionality</li>
                    <li><strong>Webview Cookies:</strong> When PetVerse opens web content in an in-app browser, those pages may set standard HTTP cookies</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How We Use Cookies / Data Storage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Functions:</strong> We store minimal local state to ensure the app works smoothly</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics and Performance:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics only if you've opted in (withdraw consent via Settings > Privacy > Share Usage Analytics)</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication & Sync:</strong> Cloud Firestore relies on local storage caching for offline support</li>
                    <li><strong>Preferences & UI Customization:</strong> We remember your theme choice or layout settings between sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Content:</strong> External websites opened in PetVerse's webview may set their own cookies under their policies</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Third-Party Cookies/Technology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Uses Android Advertising ID; only collects data if you opted in</li>
                    <li><strong>Crashlytics:</strong> May collect device info and optional user ID tags for crash reports (purged on 90-day cycle)</li>
                    <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Does not set any client-side cookies; all processing is server-side</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Your Choices and Controls</h3>
                
                <h4>To limit or reset device identifiers on Android:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open Settings > Google > Ads</li>
                    <li>Enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization"</li>
                    <li>Tap "Reset Advertising ID" to generate a new identifier</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>To clear webview cookies:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to Settings > Apps > PetVerse</li>
                    <li>Choose Storage & cache</li>
                    <li>Select "Clear storage" or "Clear cache"</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> The standard Do Not Track browser setting is not applicable in Android apps. We do not engage in cross-app tracking beyond the aggregated, opt-out-eligible analytics described above.</p>

                <h3>Changes to This Cookies Policy</h3>
                <p>We will update this policy if we change how we use cookies or similar technologies (for example, adding ad networks). We will notify you in-app for material changes.</p>
